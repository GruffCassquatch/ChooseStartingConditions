# Choose Starting Conditions
A mod for The Long Dark. 
This mod allows you to choose your starting condition, fatigue, hunger, thirst, warmth, injuries and illnesses when starting a new game. 

It is intended for use when starting a new SURVIVAL MODE game. It will do nothing to an existing game.

The idea is to let you have a more varied experience and come up with your own scenarios. 
This mod goes well with [ChooseStartingGear](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/ChooseStartingGear). 

## Requirements
[MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) 
 
[ModSettings](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases)

## Installation:
1. Download the latest ```ChooseStartingConditions.dll``` from [releases](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/ChooseStartingConditions/releases)
2. Drop ```ChooseStartingConditions.dll``` into your Mods folder

## Uninstallation:
Delete ```ChooseStartingConditions.dll``` and ```ChooseStartingConditions.json``` file from your Mods folder

## Using The Mod
1. Open the ```Options``` menu
2. Open the ```Mod Settings``` menu
3. Scroll across to the ```Choose Starting Conditions``` menu
4. Under ```Starting Conditions Options``` you can Enable or Disable the mod 
5. Use the sliders to set your Condition, Fatigue, Hunger, Thirst and Warmth. 
    * 100% is a "full" meter, so 100% thirst means you are NOT THIRSTY at all.
6. If you want to add injuries, set ```Start with Injuries``` to YES and a list of options will appear
    * The options vary by injury, but most will let you choose a location (e.g. Left Hand) and a Cause (e.g. Wolf Bite)
7. If you want to add illnesses, set ```Start with Illnesses``` to YES and a list of options will appear
    * Your chosen Survival Mode affects what illnesses you can be afflicted with, e.g. on Pilgrim mode choosing to start with Cabin Fever will do nothing
8. Once you have made your choices, click ```CONFIRM``` to apply your changes (or ```BACK``` to exit without applying changes)
